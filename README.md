# Jonny Green - Personal Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio, designed to showcase my skills and talents as a developer by acting as a landing page with links to projects that I have worked on and links to ways to get in touch with me. This portfolio will be added to throughout the bootcamp course, eventually acting as a resume of sorts when I begin interviewing.
